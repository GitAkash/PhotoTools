I export my pictures on to digikam in seperate folders, one for raw one for jpg.
I rate my RAW's and export those ratings to the jpg using "./syncXMPRatingtoJPG.sh -p 'album folder where jpg and raw folder is located'. 
Then I go to digikam, click on the jpg go topright -> album -> reread metadata from files

Now my metadata is refreshed
